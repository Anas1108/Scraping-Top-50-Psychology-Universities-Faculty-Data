# Scraping Top 50 Psychology Universities Faculty Data

## Overview
The purpose of this project is to scrape faculty data (such as name, qualification, etc.) of the top 50 psychology universities and save it in a CSV file. This project uses Beautiful Soup and the requests library in Python to accomplish this task.

## Dependencies
This project requires the following libraries to be installed in your Python environment:
- Beautiful Soup
- Requests
- CSV (part of the standard library)

## Steps to Run the Project
1. Clone or download the project repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal or command prompt.
3. Install the required libraries by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run the `main.py` script by executing `python main.py`
5. The scraped faculty data will be saved in a CSV file named `faculty_data.csv` in the project directory.

## Understanding the Code
The project has the following files:
- `main.py`: The main script that runs the scraping and saves the data to a CSV file.
- `requirements.txt`: A list of required libraries for the project.
- `faculty_data.csv`: The file that will be generated by the script and contain the scraped faculty data.

The `main.py` script starts by sending an HTTP request to the website containing the top 50 psychology universities and using Beautiful Soup to parse the HTML content of the page. It then extracts the relevant data and saves it in a list of dictionaries. Finally, it writes this list to a CSV file using the CSV library.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how to use Beautiful Soup and the requests library in Python to scrape data from a website and save it in a CSV file. The techniques and methods used in this project can be adapted and modified for different use cases and websites.
